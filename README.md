Clean Data Assignment

The script combines the test and train results, extracts only the mean() and std() results, and adds column headers describing the results.

The next step includes combining the activities for which the results were measured (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying).

And finally adding the subjects (1-30) to each of the results.

The last part of the script calculates the average for each activity by subject for each mean() and std() result set.
